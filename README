============================================================
pungi - An emacs package integrating python related pacakges
============================================================

The primary purpose of this package is to integrate the python-mode
package with jedi for ease of developing Python code with emacs.

The primary features provided are::
 * Integration with jedi, in particlar enabling jedi:goto-definition to
   work with the Python environment.
 * Integration with buildout
 * Intergation with virtualenv


These features are taken directly from::
  https://gist.github.com/nyergler/6100112

In the near future, I intend to submit this package to melpa,
at which point this will be directly installable via emacs's 
list-packages.

Installation
============

Ensure that the name "emacs" in your shell points to the emacs
executable. i.e On $PATH or aliased.

$ make clean && make pungi-1.0.tar && make install
$ restart emacs.
